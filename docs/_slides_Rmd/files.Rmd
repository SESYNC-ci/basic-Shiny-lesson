## Shiny components

Depending on the purpose and computing requirements of any Shiny app, you may set it up to run R code on your computer, a remote server, or in the cloud.
However all Shiny apps consists of the same two main components:

- The **user interface (UI)** which defines what users will see in the app and its design.

- The **server** which defines the instructions for how to assemble components of the app like plots and input widgets.

## Who or what is "Listening" on 127.0.0.1?

- 127.0.0.1 is the IP address your laptop uses for itself (it's the same as 'localhost').

- Your laptop is hosting a web page (the UI) whose content is controlled by a running R session.

- When you run an app through RStudio, that R session is also running the server on your laptop.

- The server responds when you interact with the web page, processing R commands and updating UI objects accordingly.

===

For big projects, the UI and server components may be defined in separate files called `ui.R` and `server.R` and saved in a folder representing the app.

~~~
my_app
├── ui.R
├── server.R
├── www
└── data
~~~
{:.input}

For ease of demonstration, we'll use the alternative approach of defining UI and server objects in a R script representing the app.

```{r eval=FALSE, title='my_app.R'}
# User Interface
ui <- ... 

# Server
server <- ...

# Create the Shiny App
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Hello, Shiny World!

Open `{{ site.handouts[0] }}` in your handouts repository. In this file, define objects `ui` and `server` with the assignment operator `<-` and then pass them to the function `shinyApp()`. These are the basic components of a shiny app.

```{r eval=FALSE, title='{{ site.handouts[0] }}'}
# User Interface
ui <- navbarPage(title = 'Hello, Shiny World!')

# Server
server <- function(input, output){}

# Create the Shiny App
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

===

Notice the green **Run App** button appear when the file is saved. This button also allows you to control whether the app runs in a browser window, in the RStudio Viewer pane, or in an external RStudio window.

The `shiny` package must be installed for RStudio to identify files associated with a Shiny App and put up a green arrow with a **Run App** button. Note that the file names must be `ui.R` and `server.R` if these components are scripted in separate files.
