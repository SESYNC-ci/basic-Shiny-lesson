## Accessing data

Because the Shiny app is going to be using your local R session to run, it will be able to recognize anything that is loaded into your working environment.

Here, we read in CSV files from the Portal dataset, so it is available to both the ui and server definitions.
The app script is in the same folder as `data`, and you only need to specify the _relative_ file path.

```{r eval=FALSE, title='{{ site.handouts[1] }}'}
# Data
species <- read.csv('data/species.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
animals <- read.csv('data/animals.csv', na.strings = '', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Shiny apps can also be designed to interact with remote data or shared databases.
