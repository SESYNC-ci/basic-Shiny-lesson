## Shiny Components

Depending on the purpose and computing requirements of any Shiny app, you may
set it up to run R code on your computer, a remote server, or in the cloud.
However all Shiny apps consists of the same two main components:

- The **user interface (UI)** defines what users will see in the app and
  its design.
- The **server** defines the instructions for how to assemble components
  of the app like plots and input widgets.

## Who is "Listening" on Where?

The terms "client" and "server" show up a lot in discussing Shiny. The client is
the web browser. The server is a running program that is waiting to process
requests sent by the client. For development, one computer runs both the client
and the server.

- 127.0.0.1 is the IP address your computer uses for itself (it's the same as
  'localhost').
- Your computer is hosting a web page (the UI) whose content is controlled by a
  running R session.
- When you run an app through RStudio, that R session is also running the server
  on your computer.
- The server responds when you interact with the web page, processing R commands
  and updating UI objects accordingly.

===

For big projects, the UI and server components may be defined in separate files
called `ui.R` and `server.R` and saved in a folder representing the app.

~~~
my_app
├── ui.R
├── server.R
├── www
└── data
~~~
{:.text-document.no-eval title="App Folder"}

For ease of demonstration, we'll use the alternative approach of defining UI and
server objects in a R script representing the app.

```{r, eval=FALSE, title='my_app.R'}
# User Interface
ui <- ... 

# Server
server <- ...

# Create the Shiny App
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

## Hello, World!

Open `{{ site.data.lesson.handouts[0] }}` in your handouts repository. In this file, define
objects `ui` and `server` with the assignment operator `<-` and then pass them
to the function `shinyApp()`. These are the essential components of a Shiny app.

===

```{r, eval=FALSE, handout = 0}
# User Interface
ui <- navbarPage(title = 'Hello, World!')

# Server
server <- function(input, output) {}

# Create the Shiny App
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

===

The **Run App** button in the Editor allows you to control whether the app
runs in a browser window, in the RStudio Viewer pane, or in an external RStudio
window.

The `shiny` package must be installed for RStudio to identify files associated
with a Shiny App and provide a **Run App** button. Note that the file names must
be `ui.R` and `server.R` if these components are scripted in separate files.
